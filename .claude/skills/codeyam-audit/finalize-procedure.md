# codeyam-audit procedure — align, finalize, present, drive to merge-ready

The authoritative, version-controlled body of the `/codeyam-audit` skill:
**bring this repo into full codeyam alignment, finalize it whole-repo, clean it
for presentation, and drive it to merge-ready — aggressively on deterministic
drift, but supervised on every judgment call.**

This file is the *procedure*; the sibling `SKILL.md` is the thin, stable
*contract* that points here. Durable knowledge accrues in this file so the
skill's "Reflect & self-improve" step can propose edits to **this file**
(never a silent edit to `SKILL.md`) through the standard editor workflow.

It is **self-contained**: a client project has no `CLAUDE.md` to lean on, so
every command, default, and gotcha needed to converge is written here. Read it
top to bottom on first use; on later runs, recalled memories supply the deltas.

---

## What this skill is (and is not)

- **It is the one comprehensive "finalize outside the editor workflow" entry.**
  Run it when you have accumulated deferred-finalize commits, made manual
  commits outside the workflow, or just want to bring whatever HEAD currently
  is into full alignment and merge-readiness.
- **It is aggressive on deterministic drift.** Mechanical alignment fixes
  (registry reconcile, test/evidence/description refresh, capture-script sync,
  screenshot recapture, import-graph refresh) are applied autonomously.
- **It is supervised on judgment.** A bulk unregistered-entity wall, an
  ambiguous classification (fixture vs real, testable vs untestable), and
  anything that would delete or rewrite content **stop and ask** — never an
  unsupervised mass-registration or mass-deletion.
- **It is idempotent and resumable.** Every run makes progress; re-running
  picks up where the last left off. A run ends **either** at merge-ready
  **or** at a specific, answerable question whose answer advances the next
  run. It never bails-and-abandons mid-way, and never leaves the repo
  half-aligned. "Aggressive" means *relentless toward done*, not *reckless*.
- **Outward actions stay human-gated.** Pushing the branch, opening the PR,
  and merging the PR each require explicit user confirmation — they are
  irreversible and are gated by this procedure's own logic.

There is also a **report-only mode** (see the last section): the cheap "just
tell me what's misaligned, don't touch anything" path, including the
deferred-commit attribution report. The headline behavior is the aggressive
drive; report-only is an explicit opt-in.

---

## 0. Preflight — initialized project + supported stack

**Confirm the project is initialized for codeyam-editor.**

```bash
codeyam-editor editor config-show >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "Project is not initialized for codeyam-editor. Run /codeyam-onboard first."
  exit 1
}
```

If it fails, tell the user to run `/codeyam-onboard` and stop. Do not proceed.

**Read the stack up front and gate on it.** The audit engine aligns and
finalizes per stack; on a stack it does not yet support, a partial sync would
report a half-aligned repo as clean — a false green. So fail loud and
actionable instead:

```bash
codeyam-editor editor capabilities-list --format json   # what this binary supports
cat .codeyam/stack.json                                  # this repo's declared stack
```

- **Supported stack** → drive to full sync (the rest of this procedure).
- **Unsupported stack** → stop with a precise, actionable message naming the
  stack and the supported set, e.g.:
  `/codeyam-audit does not yet fully support stack 'X'. Supported: <list>.`
  Do **not** proceed into a partial sync that would mislabel the repo as clean.

> This mirrors the engine's own stack-agnosticism contract: generalize from
> config where you can, and where you genuinely can't, **fail loud** rather
> than silently producing a false-green on an unsupported stack.

---

## The one unrecoverable rule (read before any commit)

**NEVER rebase, amend, or force-push a branch that may be shared.** A
concurrent session (or a teammate) may have committed under you at any moment.
Integrate a moved primary branch by **merging it in**, never by rebasing onto
it. Every other mistake in this procedure is recoverable; this one rewrites
history other people may be building on and cannot be undone.

**Assume shared unless told otherwise.** On a genuinely private branch the
only cost of merging is a slightly less-clean merge commit — which is never
*wrong*. So default to merge; the user can override only by explicitly saying
the branch is private.

Because a sibling can commit between any two of your commands:

- Re-check `git branch --show-current` before *every* commit — a merged-PR
  auto-switch can move you off the branch you think you're on.
- Re-check `git rev-list --count origin/<branch>..HEAD` and
  `HEAD..origin/<branch>` before committing, so you see divergence the moment
  it appears and merge it in rather than discovering it at push.

> **Fleet block** (active only when the repo participates in a shared commit
> queue — sibling sessions, a per-branch push queue). The push/finalize tail
> prints `Commit queue: ...` lines; these are normal serialization, not
> errors. Every queue bail names its own recovery command — read the bail body
> and run exactly what it says; do not hand-stitch a workaround. On a solo
> branch with no upstream the queue is disabled and this block is inert.

## 1. ORIENT — branch, debt, and the whole-repo preview

Establish where you are before changing anything.

```bash
git branch --show-current                     # safe default: the current branch
git fetch origin                              # see siblings' work without integrating yet
git rev-list --count origin/<branch>..HEAD    # commits you have that origin doesn't
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/<branch>    # commits origin has that you don't
codeyam-editor editor finalize-debt show --format json
```

`finalize-debt show` lists the deferred commits owed a full `session-finalize`.
**Zero deferred and no divergence** → the branch may already be merge-ready;
jump to step 5's `verify-full-finalize` check and short-circuit if it passes
("nothing to finalize").

**Preview the whole-repo finalize debt, not just the diff-only gate.** Any
per-step Fast-Commit gate you have been passing is **diff-scoped** — it only
sees the current diff. `session-finalize` runs the *strict, whole-repo* audit,
which can surface inherited debt (e.g. a `SOURCE_HAS_UNREGISTERED` wall) that
was invisible all session. Surface that count *now* so the size of the run is
known up front rather than discovered at the finalize wall.

> GOTCHA — **diff-scoped gate vs whole-repo finalize.** Passing every
> per-step gate does **not** mean `session-finalize` will pass. Treat a green
> session as "the diff is clean," never as "the branch is finalize-ready."

**Converge the binary AND the server before anything routed through the
server.** These are two build surfaces, not one. `rebuild-self` rebuilds and
swaps the *binary*, so your next CLI invocation runs new code; the editor
**server** is a separate long-lived process that keeps executing whatever build
it booted with until it is restarted. Test runs, gate runs and preview captures
are routed through the server, so a stale server does not make them slow — it
makes their conclusions **invalid**. Measured: a 25-minute `refresh-tests` warm
produced a completely void result because the server was running a build that
predated 61 edited files.

Read the state before you spend anything on it — the probe never builds, swaps,
or restarts:

```bash
codeyam-editor editor rebuild-self --check
```

Treat any verdict other than `current` as **blocking for server-routed work**:

| Verdict | What it means here |
|---|---|
| `current` | Binary and aliases agree with the source. Proceed. |
| `stale` | A source edit (or a failed post-swap restart) is not in the binary. Run `rebuild-self` — read the stderr guidance, which names the recovery that fits. |
| `rebuild-in-flight` | A detached worker is still building. Run `rebuild-self` to re-attach; do not start a second build. |
| `aliases-diverged` | The binary is current but the role hardlinks point at a previous generation — usually after a bare `cargo install --force`. A plain `rebuild-self` relinks them on its already-current fast path without recompiling. |

Then make sure the *server* picked the new binary up:

```bash
codeyam-editor editor restart-server
```

> GOTCHA — **`--defer-restart` is the wrong choice whenever the next step
> routes through the server.** It swaps the binary and deliberately skips the

> never at risk, guarantees the one outcome you were trying to avoid.

---

## 2. See the whole failure set at once — no fail-fast

Before fixing anything, get the *complete* list of what is broken, not the
first failure:

```bash
codeyam-editor editor audit --format json
```

Read every `failures[]` entry and the `attribution[]` array together. Each
attribution row is `{invariantId, item, introducedIn, causedByHead,
causedByBranchDrift, causedByForeignClone}` and joins back to a finding on
`(invariantId, item)`. Rows appear only for items whose introducing commit
resolved, so an item with no row is "not attributable", not "attributed to
nothing" — the same thing the text renderer means when it omits the `★`
marker. Note `--findings-only` deliberately omits the array; the default
`--format json` is what carries it.

**Read `cacheFreshness` BEFORE you quote the user a number.** The same
document carries a `cacheFreshness` sibling —
`{green, stale, red, nonGreenPartitions[], cacheDependentFindings}` — and it
is present on every projection (`--format json`, `--findings-only`,
`--summary-only --format json`), green or not, so its absence means an old
binary, never a green cache. When `nonGreenPartitions` is non-empty, the
finding count is an **upper bound, not a debt estimate**:
`cacheDependentFindings` of the total are derived from runner output or
coverage those partitions produce, and they dissolve on a refresh. Measured
on `editor-improvements-73` (2026-08-17): 39 findings on a cold cache — 112
`REGISTRY_ENTRY_RUNNER_OUTPUT_EMPTY`, 114 `REGISTRY_TEST_NOT_WIRED`, 22
`PLATFORM_GATE_MISMATCH`, 106 `UNCOVERED_GLOSSARY_ENTRY`, 111
`GLOSSARY_ENTRY_LACKS_TEST` — became **5** after a flag-free `refresh-tests`
and nothing else.

So: if `nonGreenPartitions` is non-empty, warm the cache with
`codeyam-editor editor refresh-tests` and re-run the audit before sizing the
run in front of the user. Quoting the cold number mis-prices the spend the
user is being asked to authorize — which is the whole point of surfacing a
count here. The text renderer says the same thing in a banner at the top and
bottom of the body; `cacheFreshness` is the machine-readable form so you
never have to parse the prose.

Budget for it: on a scenario-heavy repo this run takes minutes, not seconds.
It is a backgrounded long command like any other; wait on the completion
sentinel rather than assuming it hung.

**Finish your source edits BEFORE you warm the cache.** The warm is only
durable until the next source edit: touching one tracked file re-stales the
partition that owns it, and a stale partition is what step 4a's
`reconcile-registry --auto-apply` pre-flight pays a full package test run to
rediscover. That makes the warm **order-sensitive with respect to step 4**,
which nothing above says and the natural reading gets backwards — warm, size
the run, *then* start fixing is the expensive sequence. Measured on
`editor-improvements-78` (2026-08-31): a 31-minute warm left all 20
partitions green, **one** added comment line in
`crates/codeyam-editor/src/commands/editor/pre_commit_sync.rs` invalidated
it, and the next `--auto-apply` spent 55 minutes re-running partitions to
learn nothing had changed.

Keep warming before you quote a count — that instruction is correct and
load-bearing, and a cold count mis-prices the run. Just do the step-4b
judgment edits you already know you are making first, so the warm you pay
for is the warm that survives. When an edit after the warm is unavoidable,
re-check freshness before the pre-flight rather than assuming the warm
still holds:

```bash
codeyam-editor editor test-status
```

**`--findings-only` is a smaller ANSWER, not a faster run — do not reach for
it to save time.** It skips the per-file `git log` attribution walk and the
per-entity evidence projection, and that is genuinely all it skips. Measured
on codeyam-editor itself (1745 scenarios, a ~21-minute audit), attribution was
**5s — 0.4% of the run**. An agent that picks `--findings-only` expecting a
fast path waits essentially the full time and learns to distrust the docs,
which costs more than the minutes. Pick it when you want the compact
projection: the verdict, the missing-\* arrays, and a name+count summary.

The lever that actually moves wall-clock is `--concurrency`, because the bulk
of an audit is the per-scenario screenshot scan — one PNG decoded and
perceptually hashed per captured scenario. It defaults to one thread per core;
pass `--concurrency 1` to force the sequential path when you are debugging a
run whose findings look wrong. Findings are identical at every setting.

Which stage is slow is not a thing to guess at — `--timings` reports it:

```
codeyam-editor editor audit --timings --format text     # table on stderr
codeyam-editor editor audit --timings --format json     # `timings` block in the document
```

Read the `unattributed` row as well as the named stages: a large one means the
instrumentation is pointed at the wrong place, which is itself the finding.
A stage reporting `calls: 2` is doing its work twice.

Group findings by invariant id and by the commit that introduced them. Fixing
blind, one failure at a time, wastes finalize cycles — each full
`session-finalize` is the expensive loop you are trying to run *once*.

---

## 3. Don't chase deterministic churn (the stale-cache band)

Several "dirty" signals are deterministic retention churn, **not** edits to
revert:

- Deleted `.codeyam/plans/completed/*` files — the rolling completed-plan
  archive trims to a fixed cap. Every session prunes the *same* files; they
  reconcile to a no-op on merge. Do **not** `git checkout` them.
- `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_STALE` / `PARTITION_NEEDS_REFRESH` staleness-sweep
  warnings — deferred work, discharged by `session-finalize`'s reconcile, not
  something to fix by hand mid-session.
- Every finding under a non-green partition — see `cacheFreshness` in step 2.
  `REGISTRY_ENTRY_RUNNER_OUTPUT_EMPTY`, `REGISTRY_TEST_NOT_WIRED`,
  `PLATFORM_GATE_MISMATCH`, `UNCOVERED_GLOSSARY_ENTRY` and
  `GLOSSARY_ENTRY_LACKS_TEST` are computed from runner emission, so a cold
  cache manufactures them by the hundred. Warm the cache; do not fix them by
  hand.

**A cost being documented is not evidence the cost is correct.** Everything
in this band is churn you should stop chasing — but the inverse error is
just as expensive, and it wears the docs as camouflage: you recognise a slow
command's shape from `CLAUDE.md`, confirm it is healthy, and let it run,
because the duration was written down as *expected* rather than as a
*symptom*. Documentation records what a command does today, not that today's
behaviour is right. When a command's own progress output says the work it
just did was unnecessary — a partition reporting `already fresh` after
paying a multi-minute test run for it — that is a defect to report, not a
duration to absorb. This file already makes the argument one layer down for
the RSS runaway (two sessions let `reconcile-registry` reach 2 GB because
"this one is slow" was in the docs); it holds for wall-clock too.

## 4. Align — mechanical fixes first, then judgment calls

### 4a. Mechanical fixes (autonomous, deterministic, no judgment)

Apply the failures whose fix is unambiguous and scripted. These have a
`fixCommand` in the audit JSON or a named recovery:

- Registry drift → `codeyam-editor editor reconcile-registry --auto-apply`
- Import / dependency-graph staleness → `codeyam-editor editor analyze-imports`
- Post-merge drift after integrating origin →
  `codeyam-editor editor pre-commit-sync --recover` (runs
  `git pull --rebase --autostash` → `post-merge-drift-sweep` →
  `plan-cleanup-duplicates` in one shot — do **not** hand-stitch these, and do
  **not** `git add` a deleted queue-plan copy by hand).
- Duplicate plan slug on merge → the same `--recover` path handles it.

Re-run `codeyam-editor editor audit --format json` after the mechanical pass so
the remaining set is only the judgment calls.

> GOTCHA — **`reconcile-registry --auto-apply` is order-sensitive with your

### 4b. Judgment fixes (STOP and ask — never mass-apply)

What's left needs a decision, not a script. **Surface the count and the items,
present concrete options, and wait** — do not autonomously pay these down:

- **Bulk inherited debt (`SOURCE_HAS_UNREGISTERED` and friends).** Discharging
  a whole-repo wall of unregistered entities is the expensive workflow-fan-out
  path, and the user owns that token spend. Surface the count and entities and
  **ask** before registering. No unsupervised mass-registration.
- **Ambiguous classifications** — is this a test fixture? derive-generated?
  testable pure logic or an untestable shim? Apply the project's glossary
  discipline; **ask when truly unsure** rather than guessing.
- **Anything that deletes or rewrites content** — see step 6. Ask first.

> GOTCHA — **`reconcile-glossary` proposals ARE merge-blocking. Size them
> before you quote the user a number.**
> `editor reconcile-glossary` can print a long `add` list (we've seen 100+).
> That list is real, merge-required work — not polish. Two facts:
> 1. The underlying invariant, `SOURCE_HAS_UNREGISTERED_ENTITY`, carries no
>    `_ADVISORY` suffix, so `audit_failure_is_advisory` does not exempt it: it
>    reaches the **strict** gate and blocks `session-finalize` /
>    `verify-full-finalize`. Every `add` needs a `glossary-add` (or a
>    `glossary-skip-add` for a genuine test-fixture / derive-generated
>    artifact) before the branch is merge-ready.

This is the convergence contract in practice: each run fixes all the mechanical
drift it can, then stops at the **first** genuine judgment call with a specific,
answerable question. The user's answer advances the next (resumed) run.

## 5. Refresh evidence + screenshots (in the right order)

If the branch carries surfaces with visual or scenario output, the finalize
wants current evidence and screenshots.

>   and ~1,090s there.

> So when you re-price a quoted estimate (e.g. `finalize-preview`'s "budget

> *serial* timings), divide the **capture** portion by the effective
> concurrency and leave the fixed portion alone. Dividing `elapsed_seconds`
> wholesale is the same class of mis-pricing this reporting exists to stop.
>
> **`--concurrency` is not the only wall. `recapture-stale` also carries a

## 6. Presentability pass — treat the branch as open-source

Placed *after* screenshots are refreshed (step 5) so the gallery embeds the
final images, and *before* the finalize (step 7) so the suite validates the
cleanup. For a branch built entirely via Fast Commit, the per-cycle finalize
bodies rendered terse (no polish), so this is where the repo finally polishes
before merge.

```bash
# Read-only: surface stale docs + non-essential debug logging. Never deletes.
codeyam-editor editor presentability-scan

# Refresh the README how-to + scenario gallery (idempotent).
codeyam-editor editor readme-sync
```

**A `readme-sync` that exits `2` with `BLOCKED:` is a finding to act on, not a
step to skip past.** It means the README's gallery or how-to block holds content
codeyam-editor did not write — someone curated by typing between the markers —
and the sync refused rather than destroying it. Do NOT work around it by
reverting their edit or by deleting the markers (removing them makes the next
sync *append* a second, generated gallery). Read the `Next valid action:` line
and follow it: move that prose outside the markers, or move the curation into
`.codeyam/readme-gallery.json` — scaffold one with `codeyam-editor editor
readme-gallery-init`, which names scenarios by slug so their screenshots keep
refreshing. Surface it to the user when the right home for their words is not
obvious; it is their writing, and this refusal exists because a routine sync
once destroyed a hand-curated gallery with no warning.

**`Debug logging: not scanned` is NOT a pass.** It means this stack declared no
`debugLogPatterns` and has no built-in default, so the logging pass never ran
and an empty candidate list is an absence of evidence, not evidence of
cleanliness. Configure `debugLogPatterns` in `.codeyam/stack.json` (or add a
built-in default for the stack's framework token) and re-run before treating
presentability as clean. `Debug logging: none` is the line that means clean;
under `--format json` the same distinction is `debug_log_patterns_source`.

Then **assertively** remove the clearly-dead docs and debug log lines the scan
surfaces — but **ask the user about anything uncertain** before deleting it.
The scan only ever *lists* candidates; the judgment (and the deletion) is
yours, and deletion is a judgment call (step 4b): when in doubt, ask. The
step-7 finalize re-runs the suite, so a debug line a test asserted on will fail
there — revert that one removal and re-run.

> covered.

## 7. Commit → finalize → the merge-ready gate

This is the expensive loop; still aim to run it *once*, cleanly — but two
properties now make its cost proportional to the change rather than flat.

**The cheap gates fail fast.** `verify-build` and the cross-target build run
as a hoisted `Phase 0.5/5` pre-flight, ahead of the ~35-minute full suite,
and their positions at Phase 4 / 4b become a no-op re-check. So a
cargo-fmt, clippy, tsc, windows-portability, shell-tests, date-rot or
cross-target failure surfaces in minutes instead of surfacing at minute 57
of an otherwise-passing run.

**A re-run after a small fix is no longer full price.** Each phase records a
fingerprint of the inputs it actually consumes, and a later run skips a
phase whose fingerprint is unchanged, logging `Phase N/5: skipped (inputs
unchanged since <sha> at <time>)`. A one-file post-CI test fix therefore
re-runs the phases that file affects and re-stamps the marker, instead of
paying the whole hour again purely to move `lastFullFinalizeSha`. A
fingerprint that cannot be computed counts as *changed*, so the failure
direction is always "do the work".

This does **not** relax the marker-stamp trap below — `verify-full-finalize`
remains the only authority on merge-readiness. It also does not change what
`--start-from-phase` means: that still skips by operator assertion rather
than by evidence, and still cannot advance the marker.

Nor is it a licence to run the loop repeatedly. The saving is per *phase*; the
cost is per *cycle*, and a cheaper re-run is still a whole cycle — a
`pre-commit-sync` claim, a finalize, and a push. What keeps the count at one is
batching the fixes that trigger it: see 8a's *land the whole set in ONE commit*
before you fix the first red check.

```bash
# Stop fast-intent so finalize stamps the real marker, not a deferred one.
codeyam-editor editor fast-commit-stop

# Integrate any sibling commits by MERGING (never rebasing) — see rule 0.
codeyam-editor editor pre-commit-sync          # claims the commit queue; --recover if it bails

# The full, whole-repo finalize. Stamps lastFullFinalizeSha.
codeyam-editor editor session-finalize 2>&1 | tee /tmp/codeyam-audit-finalize.log
```

Only after `verify-full-finalize` exits 0 is the branch **merge-ready**.
**Stop here and report unless the user explicitly authorized the push.** When
authorized:

```bash
codeyam-editor editor push                     # the wrapper runs the deferred-finalize gate
```

`editor push` works **directly** here even though this branch never walked the
guided workflow — the wrapper proceeds past its workflow-step precondition once
`verify-full-finalize` is green (HEAD is full-finalize-covered), so there is no
need to fall back to a plain `git push`. A mid-workflow branch that is *not*
full-finalize-covered is still refused, with a message naming both routes
(advance the workflow, or run a whole-repo `session-finalize`).

If the pre-push gate complains of deferred commits, do **not** override with
`--allow-deferred`; it means finalize didn't cover the range — go back to the
marker-stamp trap above.

### Publishing a release AFTER the finalize

If this branch publishes a versioned artifact, the ordering is:

**bump → publish → commit → finalize → push** — never bump → publish → commit → push.

A version-bump / release-metadata commit (a manifest version field, a lockfile,
a changelog stamp) is a **source change like any other**. It falls outside the
stamped `lastFullFinalizeSha`, so a branch driven to `verify-full-finalize`
exit 0 and pushed silently stops being merge-ready the moment that commit
lands — and the ordinary push gates do not catch it, because they classify
manifests and lockfiles as owing no finalize. You then pay a second
`session-finalize` plus a second push to get back.

Put the release commit *inside* the finalize instead: bump and publish first,
commit the version metadata, and only then run `session-finalize` and push.

`editor push` now blocks on this rather than letting it through silently — a
`BLOCKED:` with `Next valid action: codeyam-editor editor session-finalize`
when the branch was stamped merge-ready and has drifted off it. On a feature
branch under fast intent it warns instead of blocking, matching how the same
gate treats ordinary post-finalize source commits there.

---

## 8. PR → CI → mergeability

With the branch pushed and merge-ready:

- Open or update the PR (`gh pr create` / `gh pr view`), **only on explicit
  user confirmation**.
- Track CI. Any red check is handled by 8a below — there is no shortcut.
- Drive to `gh pr view --json mergeable` → `MERGEABLE` /
  `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`. A `CONFLICTING` state means origin moved again —
  merge it in (never rebase) and re-run the finalize gate.
- Merging the PR is the final outward action — confirm with the user.
- **Merge with a stripped body — never let a squash inherit `[skip ci]`.** See
  8b below; this is not optional polish, it is the difference between the merge
  publishing a binary and publishing nothing.

**A 5xx from an outward write is not evidence the write failed. Read the
resource back before retrying.** A `502` says the *response* did not make it
back to you; it says nothing about whether the server acted. Every outward
action this section gates — opening a PR, merging one, pushing a tag, creating a
release — is one where a blind retry is more expensive than the original
failure, because the retry is not idempotent.

Both halves of that happened in a single session, and both writes had **already
succeeded**:

| Write | What it returned | What a blind retry would have done |
|---|---|---|
| `gh pr create` | HTTP 502 | Opened a **duplicate PR** for the same branch |
| `gh pr merge --squash` | HTTP 502 | Attempted a **second merge** on a just-merged branch |

So the rule, for any write this procedure gates:

```bash
# Do NOT re-run the write. Read the resource back first.
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --json number,state,url
gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit
```

If the resource is already in the state the write intended, the write
succeeded — report it as done and move on. Only retry once a read has actually
confirmed the write did not land. This generalizes past `gh`: treat *any* 5xx on
an outward action as "verdict unknown, go and look", never as "it failed, do it
again".

### 8a. Red CI is not done — investigate before you classify

**A red test is a red test. `verify-full-finalize` exiting 0 locally is
necessary but NEVER sufficient — local green does not clear red CI.** When any
CI check is red, root-cause it at the source *before* any
"known/flaky/infra/environmental" label is even considered.

**The contract — investigate-then-classify, never classify-then-defer.** For
**every** red check, in this order:

1. **Pull the actual failing-job log.** Do not reason from the check name.
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <pr>                       # list checks + buckets
   gh run view --job <job-id> --log-failed # the specific failure
   ```
2. **Extract the specific assertion or build error** — the failing test name,
   the exact `assertion failed: ...` / compile error / panic, the line. Write
   it down.
3. **Only now classify**, against the flake bar below. A classification with no
   log evidence behind it is forbidden.

**FORBIDDEN:** presenting a stop/defer question whose justification is an
un-investigated "known infra" or "known flake" label. A queued plan or a flakes
memory is **not** evidence that *this* red check is that issue — confirm the
failure signature matches first.

**Default toward fixing, not stopping.** Red CI after a push is *inside* this
skill's job, not an outward action — the default is "root-cause and fix."
Surface to the user only a genuine fork (approach A vs B with real ripple), as a
real decision, never as a defer.

**Land the whole set in ONE commit — a post-finalize commit un-stamps the
branch.** A CI run reports *every* failure it found, so the complete set is in
front of you before you fix the first one. Investigate all of them (steps 1–3
above, per red check), then land the fixes together. The reason is mechanical
rather than stylistic: `session-finalize` stamps `lastFullFinalizeSha` at the
HEAD it verified, and a commit made after that stamp moves HEAD past it — the
branch stops being merge-ready and `editor push` blocks with `Next valid action:
codeyam-editor editor session-finalize`. One fix per commit therefore buys one
whole finalize cycle per fix. Measured on `editor-improvements-76`: that loop
ran five times, 35–47 minutes each even with section 7's phase fingerprinting
skipping unchanged phases, for three fixes a single CI run had already reported
and that could have shipped in one commit.

**What a cycle actually costs, so the advice above is a price rather than an
exhortation.** On `editor-improvements-80` the same loop ran five times and cost
roughly **34, 85, 50, 87 and 50 minutes** — call it an hour a fix, with the
worst case near an hour and a half. Two things follow.

The spread is not noise, and it is the reason the cheap runs were cheap: phase
fingerprinting skipped the phases nothing had touched. On the 34-minute run,
Phase 1 reused **20 green partition caches** instead of re-running **35,841
tests**. So a batched fix set does not merely save you *n − 1* runs — it keeps
the runs it does cost in the cheap band, because a commit that touches one area
leaves the other phases' fingerprints intact. Interleaving unrelated fixes
across separate commits is what dirties every phase and prices each cycle at the
top of that range.

And an hour is long enough that the batching decision is worth making
deliberately *before* the first fix, not discovered at the second. When CI hands
you three failures, the choice is between roughly one hour and roughly four.

**The flake bar — "flake" requires proof of non-determinism.** A check may be
labeled a flake ONLY when it **passed on a re-run with no code change**, OR it
**exactly matches a documented flake by test name AND failure signature**. A
check that fails on two consecutive runs with the same signature is **by
definition not a flake — it is a real bug. Fix it.** Build/compile errors and
assertion mismatches are never flakes.

**Documented flake family — the port/process TOCTOU.** A single test in the
real-port / real-process family (`port_reclaim` first-free, broker restart /
survival, reverse-proxy controller boot, a git-tree-oid `finalize_debt` check)
that fails in the ~21k-test parallel finalize Phase 1 but is **green via
`test-on-base` / in isolation**, with the *failing test rotating run-to-run*, is
this environmental family — a sibling test stealing a just-freed ephemeral port
in a bind→drop→reacquire window. Do NOT weaken the E2E assertion. Harden it
through `free_local_port_retry(|port| …)` (the bindable-direction helper beside
`unbound_local_port` in each crate's `test_net` / `test_support`), which retries
on a fresh port when the drawn one was stolen; new offenders are caught at
`verify-build` by the `test-port-races` static check. A *new* racy test the lint
flags is a real bug to fix now, not a flake.

**Clear `REGISTRY_HAS_FOREIGN_HOST_GATED_TEST` mechanically, never by hand.** A
test that gains a `#[cfg(target_os = …)]` / `#[cfg(unix)]` (or whose enclosing
module/file does) drifts its registry `platform_gate` from source and raises this
finding. The remedy is `codeyam-editor editor reconcile-registry --auto-apply`,
which now re-infers the source cfg for **existing** entries and rewrites a
disagreeing (or missing) gate in place — in either direction, including
*clearing* a stale gate when source verifiably declares no cfg — or
`backfill-platform-gates` for the fill-only bulk case (`None → Some`, never
overwriting a concrete gate). Do NOT hand-edit with a per-test
`register-test --platform-gate`; the finding's `fix_command` names the
mechanical path.

**It is mechanical, not unconditional — and it now tells you when it did
nothing.** The inference only trusts an entry whose recorded `line` still
points at the item its key names; a drifted line is declined rather than
stamped from a neighbouring attribute. So a run can legitimately repair zero
entries. It no longer hides that: each declined entry is printed with the
token it would have stamped, and the command exits **2** (not 0) when gate
drift was detected and none was repaired — a `fix_command` that exits 0
having changed nothing is indistinguishable from one that worked. Recover by
re-anchoring (`refresh-tests` re-derives `line` from runner output) and
re-running, or repair one entry with `register-test … --clear-platform-gate`.

### 8b. A squash merge must not inherit a plan commit's `[skip ci]`

A squash merge concatenates **every** branch commit message into the merge
commit's body, and GitHub Actions honors a skip token **anywhere** in that
message — not just on the subject line. So ANY branch commit carrying `[skip ci]`
— a plan commit made on `main` before the branch was cut, a cherry-pick, a
hand-written one — makes the default `gh pr merge --squash` land that token on
the primary branch and silently skip the entire `cicd` workflow for the merge
commit.

Nothing announces it. On 2026-08-09 PR #100 merged as `6baba063b` with no CI run
at all: no `codeyam-editor-binary:main-6baba063b` was published, no cloud image
was built, and `fleet-advance-to.sh`'s retag resolved its source to a tag that
exists nowhere — the newest `main-*` tag stayed ~130 commits stale.

**Compose the body explicitly, with the token stripped:**

```bash
gh pr view <n> --json body -q .body > /tmp/pr-body.md
bash scripts/lib/ci-skip-token.sh --strip < /tmp/pr-body.md > /tmp/pr-body.stripped.md
gh pr merge <n> --squash --body-file /tmp/pr-body.stripped.md
```

Use the script rather than a hand-written `sed`: it knows every token GitHub
honors (`[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]`, `[actions skip]`,
`***NO_CI***`), and it avoids `sed -i`, whose in-place flag differs between BSD
and GNU — the merge is run from laptops and cloud VMs alike.

**Do NOT stop `/codeyam-plan` emitting `[skip ci]`.** The token is right on a
plan-only commit that targets `main`, which is the only case that emits it —
`/codeyam-plan` and `/review-session` both OMIT it on a branch, where it would
suppress the open PR's own run. The defect is it *escaping into a squash body*.

**That branch exception does not make the strip step above unnecessary.** It
narrows who emits the token, not who can carry one: a branch commit that picked
one up from any source must still not reach a squash body, so compose the merge
body with `ci-skip-token.sh --strip` regardless.

**After merging, confirm the merge commit actually got a run:**

```bash
codeyam-editor editor verify-primary-branch-ci
```

Exit `0` means a run exists. Exit `2` names the sha and the one command that
recovers it (`gh workflow run cicd --ref main`). A `gh` that cannot answer, a
non-GitHub remote, or a repo that defines no workflows at all reports
unknown/not-applicable and exits `0` — this check never turns a network hiccup,
or a project that simply has no CI, into a red gate.

## Cross-platform pitfalls

> **Cross-platform block** — active only when the branch carries
> platform-specific surface (multiple target OSes, conditional-compilation, a
> desktop crate, CI/container build files, OS-dependent networking/error
> classification). On a single-platform stack with none of these, this section
> is inert. `session-finalize` itself prints a cross-platform advisory only
> when it detects such surface.

A green local finalize on **one** OS does not prove the branch is CI-green when
it carries platform-specific surface. The categories to watch, and the concrete
footguns behind each (all observed in real CI-fix rounds):

- **Conditional-compilation code** (`cfg(target_os …)`, `cfg(windows)`, and
  equivalents). The other platform's branch never compiled on your host, so a
  dead-code/type error there fires only in CI. A cross-target compile/lint pass
  (`codeyam-editor editor cross-check`) re-evaluates every config for a
  cross-target triple locally, in seconds.
- **A desktop GUI member** (e.g. a Tauri crate). It links platform GUI
  libraries, so a change can break a headless workspace build in a GUI-less
  container though it is clean on a developer laptop. The CI/image build must
  also *copy* the desktop dir even when the build excludes it, or the image
  build breaks on a missing directory.
- **CI / container build files** (`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `Dockerfile*`).
  The build invocation itself changed; local build success says nothing about
  the CI or image build. The CI workflow is the authority on which invocations
  CI actually runs.
- **Networking error classification** (connect-vs-timeout, refused-vs-reset).
  Socket semantics diverge by OS: a connection to an unbound localhost port is
  *refused* (RST) on Unix but *times out* on Windows, and an HTTP response
  written without reading the request gets an RST on Windows. A classifier or
  assertion verified on one OS can misbehave on another.
- **Phase/error assertions bound to a platform-dependent message.** An
  assertion matching the exact text of an OS-specific error passes on the host
  that produces that text and fails elsewhere. Make errors name their phase
  explicitly rather than asserting on incidental wording.
- **The skipped-platform-test-job trap** — a *false* green. A CI matrix runs
  each platform's TEST job only after that platform's BUILD job succeeds. When
  the build fails (e.g. an unguarded `std::os::unix::*` in a test breaks the
  windows-gnu build with `E0433`), the dependent test job is **skipped** — so a
  matrix where every *run* job is green can have skipped a whole platform, and
  any pre-existing failures on that platform stay invisible. A green CI run is
  not proof a platform was exercised; a *skipped* build's tests never ran.

**MANDATE — when this surface is present, run the local repros BEFORE the first
push, not after CI tells you:**

- `codeyam-editor editor cross-check` — compile/lint every cross-target locally,
  in seconds. This is also now **enforced**: `session-finalize` runs the
  cross-target checks as a gating phase (Phase 4b) whenever it detects
  compile-affecting platform surface, and FAILS on a real cross-target
  compile/clippy error (missing toolchains SKIP with an install hint, never
  block). So the gate and this guidance reinforce each other — do not treat
  `cross-check` as optional when the branch touches platform surface.
- `codeyam-editor editor session-finalize --linux` — run the actual suite on
  Linux before merge, so a Linux-only test failure gates locally instead of in
  CI.

When a cross-target build fails, expect the skipped-platform-test-job trap:
finalize names it explicitly, and you must treat that platform's tests as
UNVERIFIED until the build is fixed and its suite actually runs.

## Report-only mode (the cheap, touch-nothing path)

When the user just wants "tell me what's misaligned, don't touch anything,"
run the report and stop:

1. **Summarize the debt.** `codeyam-editor editor finalize-debt show --format
   json` → the `deferred[]` list.
2. **Run the audit read-only.** `codeyam-editor editor audit --format json` →
   `failures[]` + `attribution[]`.
3. **Attribute and report.** Intersect each `attribution[].introducedIn` SHA
   with the `deferred[].sha` list. Group findings by the deferred commit that
   introduced them, present the grouped report, and **stop** — apply nothing.

This preserves the old report-only audit value (and its deferred-commit
attribution) as an explicit early-exit. The default headline path is the
aggressive align→finalize→present→merge-ready drive above.

---

## Reflect & self-improve (the last step every run)

After the branch reaches merge-ready (or the run stops at a judgment call), run
a **bounded, honest** reflection. The skill gets better every time it runs —
but it must never silently rewrite its own `SKILL.md`.

Enumerate the friction this run actually hit: every workaround you had to
invent, every GOTCHA that bit, every step whose guidance was stale or missing,
every CLI whose real behavior differed from this procedure. Then route each
genuinely-new, non-obvious lesson through one of two channels — never a silent
self-edit:

1. **Durable lesson → persistent memory** (ungated, auto-recalled). Write a
   memory file: one fact per file, update an existing file rather than
   duplicate, add the one-line index pointer, and skip anything already
   captured by the repo, this procedure, or an existing memory.
2. **Structural gap → a proposed plan/diff the user approves.** When the lesson
   is bigger than a memory — this procedure is wrong, a step is missing — draft
   a plan (or a concrete diff) against **this file**
   (`.claude/skills/codeyam-audit/finalize-procedure.md`) and surface it for
   approval. Because the change flows through the standard editor workflow, the
   skill never edits its own `SKILL.md` unseen.

If the run was clean, say **"nothing new learned"** and write nothing. Do not
manufacture busywork edits.
