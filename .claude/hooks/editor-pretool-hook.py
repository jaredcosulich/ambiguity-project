PreToolUse hook for editor mode — blocks tool execution outside allowed slugs.

Reads `.codeyam/editor-step.json` for the active slug and
`.codeyam/cache/step-metadata.json` for the per-slug capability
allowlists, then blocks:
- Write/Edit to non-`.codeyam/`, non-`.claude/` files at slugs that
  don't carry the code-change capability.
- Bash `git commit` / `git add` outside slugs in `commitSlugs`.
- Bash `git push` outside slugs in `pushSlugs`.
- Bash test runs (`refresh-tests` / raw runners) at slugs NOT in
  `testRunSlugs` — every phase whose `test_scope` is `none`. Pre-Demo
  slugs are blocked to hold the prototype-speed "no tests before Demo"
  boundary; post-hardening slugs (presentation, journal, sync, commit,
  push) are blocked because a test run is out of scope at a gate. The
  `noTestSlugs` projection says which kind a slug is, so the refusal
  names a recovery that actually exists at that position.
- AskUserQuestion at slugs in `previewRequiredSlugs` unless
  `.codeyam/preview-shown.json` matches the current step.

One rule is deliberately NOT step-scoped: the scripted-source-rewrite
guard. CLAUDE.md's ban on machine-rewriting tracked source holds in
every session, editor mode or not, so that guard runs before the
`CODEYAM_EDITOR_ACTIVE` short-circuit in `main`.

The slug allowlists are projected into the cache by
`crates/codeyam-editor/src/commands/editor/slug_capabilities.rs` (the
single source of truth for per-slug capabilities), so a future
workflow renumbering never silently breaks a gate.

The Plan-tab PTY does not set `CODEYAM_EDITOR_ACTIVE`, so this hook is
silent there by design — Plan-tab commits are always allowed.

Returns exit code 2 to block, 0 to allow. Stderr is fed back to
Claude as feedback, and every refusal carries an `Evidence:` line
stating what was actually observed — the resolved project dir, the
file consulted, expected versus found — so a block is debuggable
without reading this source.

Heredoc bodies are elided before any command is lexed
(`elide_heredoc_bodies`): a commit-message body is data by shell
semantics, and lexing one as shell turned backticked code spans into
commands and a single apostrophe into an unterminated quote that
failed four guards closed at once.

Run with `--explain` to get the verdict and its evidence on STDOUT at
exit 0, changing nothing: it records no repeat fingerprint and never
writes to stderr. The flag is read from argv only — never from the
environment or the event — so nothing on the enforcement path can
reach it.

    source, which is what agents did: one spent ~10 tool calls grepping
    this file to discover its own cwd had drifted, a fact the refusal held
    and did not print.

    The repeat fingerprint is `rule` + `detail` + the actual `call` + the

    refused under one rule from escalating to "this exact call was refused

    approach. Including the evidence resets the counter when the consulted
    state genuinely changed, so a corrective action is no longer scolded as
    a repeat.

    the agent is not the only reader. Every one of these refusals is rendered
    into the client's Build tab in red, and a bare `BLOCKED: this pipes a
    gating command into a filter` reads to a watching human as the system
    falling over, when it is in fact the system doing precisely its job. On
    the sessions that were measured, 13 of 71 red results were guardrails
    working exactly as designed. The clause is deliberately INSIDE the reason
    rather than on a line above it, so the `BLOCKED: ` first-token contract
    that agents and `is_recovery_contract` grep for is left untouched.

# temp/untracked path all stay allowed.

# Suffixes whose files a reviewer reads as a diff, and which must therefore be
# edited with the Edit tool rather than machine-rewritten. Deliberately broad
# and additive across stacks: a language absent from this list is simply not
# guarded, so an unlisted extension degrades to "allow", never to a spurious
# block. `.json` is omitted on purpose — rewriting JSON through a parser is

# four are properties of the command's own output — a meaningful exit code, a
# liveness heartbeat, and a tail-safe completion trailer — which is what the
# gates whose exit code is a verdict and the long ones that heartbeat while they
# run all carry. Piping a small read-only query (`registry-query … | jq .`)
# loses nothing, and refusing it would make the rule feel arbitrary rather than
# earned.
#
# The fourth is stronger and is why the `preview` family is listed: a SIDE
# EFFECT A LATER GATE DEPENDS ON. `preview`, `preview-flow`, `preview-html`,
# `preview-interact`, `preview-verify`, and `show-results` each write the
# preview-shown marker
# (`.codeyam/preview-shown.json`) that `present-interactive` reads before it will
# allow an `AskUserQuestion`. A downstream `head -1` closes the pipe and SIGPIPEs
# the process mid-command, so the loss is invisible: the capture succeeds, the
# screenshots are correct, the body reports `success=true`, and only the gate
# stays shut. That cost five VM-13 sessions a wall each. The marker write now
# precedes every stdout write in those commands, which makes the loss
# unreachable — this entry is defense in depth, not the fix. `preview-nav`
# writes no marker; it rides along so the rule is "don't pipe the preview
# family" rather than an exception nobody will remember. `preview-show` writes
# none either, and that one is deliberate rather than incidental: it is
# read-only on the live pane (it broadcasts no nav and captures nothing), so it
# reports where a preview WOULD render without ever rendering one — marking off
# it would open the gate on a frame no user ever saw.

    recovered from disk and the fourth cannot happen: every subcommand in
    `_GATING_SUBCOMMANDS` runs inside the liveness bracket, where stdout is a
    pipe the command's own process owns, so a departed filter can no longer
    SIGPIPE it mid-run. What a pipe still costs is the terminal DISPLAY, the
    shell-level exit code, and — when the run is auto-backgrounded — the
    COMPLETION NOTIFICATION. This names where each was written instead.

    That third cost is the one this notice used to get wrong, by claiming a
    pipe cost "exactly two things". A filter that outlives the command holds the
    pipeline open, so the harness task never exits and no notification is ever
    going to fire; the command meanwhile finished and wrote its verdict.
    Observed 2026-08-23 on a `session-checkpoint` piped through `grep | tail`:
    verdict on disk in 343s, agent still waiting hours later, because "no
    notification yet" is indistinguishable from "still running" unless something
    says otherwise. The root leak that produced it is fixed, but any long-lived
    process the command leaves behind can hold a pipe open, so the agent still
    needs to know the verdict does not depend on the notification.

    Saying it at all — rather than allowing silently — is the point. The
    pipeline's `$?` is the filter's, and an agent that reads it will believe a
    failed gate passed. The notice has to arrive BEFORE the command runs,
    because afterwards the misleading exit code is already in hand."""

    - `-f` WITHOUT `-x`. `-x` matches the program name, which a shell's long

    - THE PATTERN ACTUALLY MATCHES THE COMMAND TEXT. This is what makes the

      lets the classic bracket trick through. `pgrep -f '[c]odeyam-editor'`
      contains no literal `codeyam-editor` run for its own regex to find, so it
      does not self-match, and it is correctly not flagged.

# ── write-target resolution ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scripted-rewrite guard falls back to "every tracked path the command
# MENTIONS" whenever a write target is opaque. That fallback is right for a
# target that genuinely cannot be known, and wrong for the two shapes that
# used to reach it needlessly (four refusals in one session, 2026-09-18):
#
#   - a target held in a variable bound to a string literal in the same
#     command — `p = '.codeyam/tmp/batch.json'` … `open(p, 'w')`, or
#     `P=/tmp/notes.md` … `sed -i '' 's#a.rs#b.rs#' "$P"`. Resolving the
#     binding makes the target explicit, so the write is judged on what it
#     actually writes rather than on the tracked paths it merely mentions;
#   - a write construct that is itself DATA — inside a Python/JS string
#     literal or comment, or inside a quoted argument or heredoc handed to a
#     program that does not execute it. Quoting `open(p, 'w')` in order to
#     test, log or describe the guard is not a write.
#

# still falls through to the mention scan, so the failure direction stays a
# refusal, never an unguarded rewrite.

    `write_targets`' construct verdict, carried through so the refusal can
    describe an append as an append.

    `target_inferred` is True when `tracked_path` came from the opaque
    fallback below rather than from a resolved write target — the command
    MENTIONS it, and writes somewhere the parse could not see. The refusal owes
    that distinction: one session was told its heredoc "machine-rewrites"
    `step_handoff.rs`, a path that appeared only inside a replacement string,
    while the file it actually wrote was an untracked plan.

    Detection is WHOLE-COMMAND, unchanged: a command qualifies only when it
    BOTH carries a write construct AND that write lands on tracked source.
    When every write target resolves — a literal path, or a variable bound to
    literals in the same command, which is the shape the real incidents took
    (`p = "…/opencode.rs"` … `open(p, "w")`, with the assignment and the write
    on different lines) — only those paths are judged, so a write to a temp
    file is not refused for the tracked paths it merely mentions. When a
    target is still opaque, it falls back to every tracked source path the
    command mentions. Narrowing that fallback to a single stage silently
    disarms the guard on exactly the cases it covers.

    Stage ATTRIBUTION is layered on top so the refusal can name the offending
    half of a compound command. One session ran `cp <file> <backup> && perl
    -0pi …`; the whole call was refused, so the backup never happened and the

# `rm -rf crates/codeyam-editor/.codeyam` was issued in the belief that it was
# stray generated output; it was 12 git-TRACKED fixture files, and nothing said
# so until a later `git status`.
#
# The mistake was reasonable. `.codeyam/` at the repo root IS internal cache
# state (it is in `ALWAYS_EXCLUDED_DIRS`), and the same directory name one level
# down inside a crate is a tracked test fixture. That ambiguity is not going
# away — which is exactly why the guard keys on git-tracked-ness rather than on
# a denylist of directories that "look like cache". A denylist is the reasoning
# that caused the loss. Whether git tracks a file is the fact that actually
# matters, it is cheap to ask, and it generalizes to every fixture directory in
# every client project.
#
# There is deliberately no bypass flag. A rule an agent can wave away under time
# pressure is not a guard, and a genuinely intended deletion of tracked files
# already has a reversible, reviewable spelling: `git rm`.

    Asked as TWO pathspecs, which is not redundancy. Git's directory-prefix
    rule — the thing that makes the bare path `fixtures/.codeyam` match every
    file beneath it — applies only to a LITERAL pathspec. The moment the
    operand carries a glob the pattern is fnmatched instead, and
    `crates/*/.codeyam` matches no file at all, because the real entries carry
    a `/editor.json` tail the pattern does not cover. That is exactly the shape
    that would wipe the fixture out of every crate at once, so it cannot be the
    one shape that slips through. Appending `/*` gives the glob case a pattern
    that does match, and costs the literal case nothing (`ls-files` reports
    each index entry once however many pathspecs select it).

    Returns 0 when the path escapes the repo, is not pathspec-safe, or git
    cannot answer. Those are all "this guard has nothing to say", not "this is
    safe": a path outside the repo is not git's to protect, and a guard that
    blocked on an unanswerable question would refuse ordinary `rm -rf /tmp/…`
    and `rm -rf node_modules` on every project where git happens to be
    unavailable.

    Two shapes are statically undecidable and therefore NOT covered, by
    construction rather than by oversight: an unexpanded variable
    (`rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"`) and a `find … -exec rm -rf {} +` placeholder. In
    both the operand names no path until the shell or `find` produces one, and

# ── windowed hand-off read guard ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# The saved step hand-off is an INSTRUCTION file, and a window of one is the
# single read shape with no trustworthy interpretation: the lines that come
# back are accurate, and nothing in them says a section body was cut.
#
# Observed: an agent read its step-3 hand-off with
# `sed -n '160,260p' .codeyam/state/last-advance.txt`. The window ended
# exactly on a `━━━ ASK WHETHER TO KEEP ASKING ━━━` banner, so it got the
# heading and none of the body, never asked the question that section told it
# to ask, and had no signal anything was missing — the read exited 0 with text
# that looked complete BECAUSE it ended on a heading. The user caught it turns
# later.
#
# BLOCK, not notice — the opposite call from `inspector_nudge` above, and the
# asymmetry is what decides it. Hand-parsing a JSON store is wasteful but
# recoverable inside the same turn; a half-read instruction file costs
# SILENTLY UNEXECUTED INSTRUCTIONS discovered turns later. This is the hook's
# own criterion for its blocking half: the cases where there is no reading
# under which the result is trustworthy. And a block strands nobody, which is
# the condition `inspector_nudge` reasons from in the other direction —
# `cat` and `step-handoff --section` are always-available COMPLETE
# alternatives, so there is no legitimate question this refusal leaves
# unanswerable.
#
# `grep` and a whole-file `cat` stay allowed on purpose: locating a section is
# not reading a window of one, and `cat` is the recovery the pointer line has
# always named.
_HANDOFF_STORE = ".codeyam/state/last-advance.txt"

# The hand-off text lives in FIVE places, byte-identical, and this guard used to
# reach one of them. The other four are what an agent actually reaches for once
# the `cat` is truncated, so a guard on the canonical path alone was a fence
# across the least-used door:
#
#   1. `.codeyam/state/last-advance.txt`      — the canonical store.
#   2. `.codeyam/state/last-step-show.txt`    — the read-only `--show` render.
#   3. `.codeyam/state/command-output/runs/advance-<runId>.txt`
#                                             — the run-keyed transcript.
#   4. the harness's persisted tool result    — an OPAQUE filename, so it is
#                                               matched by CONTENT, below.
#   5. the harness's task output for a
#      BACKGROUNDED command                   — likewise matched by CONTENT.
#
# Observed on the mirrors specifically: `sed -n '1,200p' …/tool-results/<id>.txt
# | sed -n '40,200p'` at three separate steps of one session, and an
# `awk '/━━━ ASK WHETHER TO KEEP ASKING ━━━/,…'` over the run-keyed transcript
# in another. Identical hazard, unguarded.
#
# Door 5 is the MOST travelled of the five, not a corner case: `advance` is in
# `_GATING_SUBCOMMANDS`, so every advance is auto-backgrounded and its hand-off
# lands in the task output, which the agent then retrieves with `wait-for`. One
# session windowed exactly that FOURTEEN times, once per step, with
# `wait-for … | sed -n '/BEGIN STEP/,$p' | head -12` — a window that starts AT
# the banner, so the checklist the trailer says is "printed above this trailer"
# is discarded wholesale, and then ends on another banner, handing back a
# heading with no body. It reads as complete and is not.
#
# Widening this is only safe BECAUSE the delivery side landed with it: blocking
# the mirrors while `cat` still truncated would have left no way to read a
# hand-off at all. That is why the plan made them one change.

# any read verb touching `.codeyam/` and it only ever advises. This guard is
# the narrow, always-on companion for the one shape that keeps recurring —
# a command that PARSES a `.codeyam/` store as JSON.
#
# The measurement that motivates it: across 12 autonomous sessions agents
# hand-parsed `.codeyam/` state with ad-hoc `json.load` heredocs 84 times in
# 10 of the 12, producing 12 `JSONDecodeError` crashes. `journal-commit-message`
# scored ZERO uses against 34 hand-rolls and 36 hardcoded timestamps — and it
# was already documented by name in the very CLAUDE.md table whose other
# commands enjoy healthy adoption. Prose has now failed twice on that one, so
# it gets the mechanical instrument instead.
#
# Two verdicts, and the split is deliberate:
#
#   NOTICE for a mapped store — reading state by hand is wasteful, not
#   incorrect, and a block would strand a legitimate one-off inspection.
#   Same asymmetry `inspector_nudge` reasons from.
#
#   BLOCK for the two cases where there is no reading under which the
#   result is TRUSTWORTHY. Parsing `state/command-output/*` is parsing a
#   live tee of two interleaved streams — not a document, and no
#   brace-matcher makes it one (one session wrote four successive
#   brace-balancing heredocs against it before giving up). Building a commit
#   body from a hand-named journal entry silently attributes another
#   feature's description, which is precisely what the command's own entry
#   resolution exists to prevent.
#
# It fires BEFORE the `CODEYAM_EDITOR_ACTIVE` short-circuit, unlike
# `inspector_nudge`: a commit body carrying the wrong feature's description
# is just as wrong outside the editor workflow as inside it.

    warrants a pointer. `inspector` is None for every blocking kind: each
    carries its recovery in `scripted_state_read_refusal` rather than in the
    shared store table, so none of them perturbs what `matching_inspector`
    reports.

    All three blocking cases are tested BEFORE the table lookup AND before the
    write exclusion. Order is the whole mechanism, twice over.

    Before the table, because a hand-named journal entry also matches the
    broader `.codeyam/journal` row, and letting the table win would downgrade
    a misattributed commit body to a pointer.

    Before the write exclusion, because the canonical failure WRITES: it reads
    a journal entry and writes the commit body out. When that output path is a
    variable rather than a literal, `write_targets` reports it opaque, and an
    exclusion applied first would suppress the block on precisely the shape
    the guard exists for. The exclusion protects the sanctioned scenario
    write, which is a `.codeyam/scenarios/` write — never a parse of the
    command-output tee, never a regex carved out of the harness's own capture
    of one, and never a commit body built from an eyeballed timestamp. No
    blocking case has a reading under which the result is trustworthy,
