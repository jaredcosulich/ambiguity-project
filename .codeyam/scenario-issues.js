// Derive which origin a capture actually loaded from, and whether that differs
// from the origin the VIEWER's browser is served.
//
// The two can legitimately differ: the capture browser runs where the app is,
// the viewer may not, and aiming them independently is what makes a capture
// work on a cloud VM at all. A capture that renders perfectly from the app's
// own origin while the user's pane sits on `/__codeyam_preview` is a USEFUL
// result — but only if the difference travels with it instead of having to be
// inferred from a URL the reader must parse themselves.
//
// Both unknowns resolve toward "no split", never toward a guess. A caller that
// supplies no `viewerOrigin` (every pre-existing call site) and a `url` with no
// parseable origin both yield `false`, so no existing consumer sees a changed
// verdict and an unclassifiable capture is never reported as diverging.
//
// Deliberately not reusing `isCrossOriginRequest` from scenario-check.js: that
// module imports THIS one, so depending on it would invert the dependency, and
// its fail-safe answers a different question (never strip markers) than this
// one does (never claim a split).
